# Azure Data Factory Export Action

GitHub Action that exports all the Azure Data Factory resources stored in your Git repository to an ARM Template using the [Azure Data Factory utilities](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/azure-data-factory-utilities) package.

## When to use

The action is particularly useful on deployment scenarios, where a step can be added in a workflow to generate a Data Factory ARM template from a Git repository branch and then use it as the source for an ARM template deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure your Data Factory is connected with a Git repository. For more info, see [Connect to a Git repository](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/source-control#connect-to-a-git-repository) and [Bicep & ARM Template formats](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.datafactory/factories?tabs=bicep).

2. Ensure the following `package.json` file exists in the same directory that contains your Data Factory resources in the Git repository:

    ```json
    {
      "scripts":{
        "build":"node node_modules/@microsoft/azure-data-factory-utilities/lib/index"
      },
      "dependencies":{
        "@microsoft/azure-data-factory-utilities":"^0.1.5"
      }
    }
    ```

### Example Usage

```yml
steps:
  - name: Export ARM Template
    id: export
    uses: Azure/data-factory-export-action@v1.2.1
    # with:
    #   path: ./mydir [optional]
    #   id: <data factory resource ID> [optional]

  - name: Publish ARM template
    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
    with:
      name: my-artifact
      path: ${{ steps.export.outputs.arm-template-directory }}
      if-no-files-found: error
```

> Note: The action creates an `armTemplate` subdirectory dynamically and exports the ARM Template (`ARMTemplateForFactory.json`) inside it.

### Inputs

- `path` (optional): Directory that contains all Data Factory resources. Defaults to `./` directory.

- `id` (optional): Data Factory resource ID. Defaults to `/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/resourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.DataFactory/factories/dataFactory`.

### Outputs

- `arm-template-directory`: Directory where the generated ARM template is stored.
